# Rainfall-Thresholds
Determine Rainfall Thresholds for landslides, based on rainfall data from the years 2010-2016 in Kalimpong, India. The cumulative rainfall - duration (E-D) thresholds were calculated using (i) Bayesian statistical technique (Guzzetti et al.,2007) and (ii) Frequentist Method (Melillo et al.,2018), at different exceedance probabilities and their respective uncertainties. These thresholds are used to identify rainfall conditions responsible for the failures and might be implemented in an early warning system.
